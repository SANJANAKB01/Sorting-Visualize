# Sorting Visualizer - Interactive Algorithm Visualizer
### Sorting Visualizer (HTML + CSS + JavaScript)
An interactive, beginner-friendly web application that lets you visualize and understand how different sorting algorithms work step-by-step. It provides an engaging way to see the inner workings of popular sorting techniques through smooth, colorful animations.
You can control the array size, adjust the speed, and watch how the elements swap and settle into order — helping you grasp the core logic behind each algorithm in real time.
Perfect for students, educators, and anyone curious about Data Structures and Algorithms!


# 🚀 Features
- 📊 Visualize Popular Sorting Algorithms:
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more (easily extendable for additional algorithms).
- 🎨 Fully Adjustable Settings:
Change the number of array bars and control the sorting speed to slow down or speed up the animation, depending on your preference.
- 🔄 Random Array Generator:
Instantly generate new arrays with random values to test different scenarios every time.
- 🖱️ User-Friendly Controls:
Simple buttons to start, pause, stop, and reset the sorting process anytime.
- 🧩 Step-by-Step Visualization:
Each step of the algorithm is animated so you can clearly see comparisons and swaps happening live.
- 💻 Responsive Design:
Works seamlessly across different screen sizes — desktop, tablet, or mobile.
- 🎓 Educational Tool:
Great for students and teachers to demonstrate how sorting algorithms work in CS classes or coding workshops.
- 🌟 Open-Source and Extensible:
Clean, modular code structure makes it easy to add new algorithms or customize visual styles.
